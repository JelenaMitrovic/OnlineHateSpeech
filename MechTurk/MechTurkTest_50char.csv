Sure they were slaves on beforehand, but that's because the africans knew whites would buy them. And of course the profits from the sale (weapons and others) would be used to catch more slaves, for more profit. If not for the slave trade, the Africans slave traders would buy some slaves, saturate their society with as many as they could, then end the slaving or at least do it at a replacement-level slaving. Instead they sold off their stock and had to replenish."

If I threatened to cut off my dick and slit my pecs open to stuff ky jelly in to make myself look I have tits, I would be considered insane and brought to the nearest hospital. The cops would likely be called to as I would be deemed a danger to myself.

For some reason though if you get your dick cut off and fake tits installed under the supervision of some fucked up medical doctor, then that is accepted.

I think the real question here is why aren't people allowed to just cut off their own dick now as a sign of ""gender neutrality"" and ""death to the cis male white patriarchy"" thingy?

Granted yes you did fuck up but, at the same time you still took that chance. Imagine still being Blue pill. Would you have even tried half the things you did with her? Or would of you just hope for the best and prayed that GOD or cupid send a bitch your way.

People who make mistakes tend to just stop growing and never attempt to do anything again once they failed to be perfect. This is a mistake to learn from not shame yourself completely with it. That type of thinking is a trap door that will limit you in ever growing at all. Never fall victim to falling inside of it

You are aware of the red pill and took a chance. Yes you fucked up but at the same time you are aware and learning from your mistakes.

You took a chance and made a mistake yes, but at the same time you are AT LEAST walking towards some type of path. 

Imagine being the person just watching the game of life from the sidelines as the years pass. When he turns around death will be waiting for him. All this time he just stood there watching life go on instead of getting in the game. Why was he even born to begin with? Never let that be you. Just learn from you mistakes and keep being aware.

Oliver Campbell has some problems, namely that he led the campaign to censor things that he found racist in The Stanley Parable. Pretty much every gamergator believes in developers deserving freedom from censorship, so this might be a gotcha if the other side of the debate has done its homework.

Also (this is relatively minor but) I'm pretty sure he said something nuts like how Martin Luther King Jr. would have been a gamergate supporter, which is incredibly cringey for anyone to say, let alone a journalist.

PLEASE NOT MILO, for obvious reasons. There is a laundry list of reasons for him to skip this. We don't need an unethical journalist representing a movement about ethics in journalism. Also, he's said fouler things about gamers than Leigh Alexander ever did up until the very second that gamers happened to be in the crosshairs of his ideological enemy.

It's tearing down everything our forefathers have worked for. All they strived for is being used BUT denounced at the same time. People are reaping the benefits they procured BUT shitting on their names because of wacky neo-ethics and moralist higher-than-thou attitudes. People on the past were as infallible as us, but they weren't ""le oppresor idiot unenlightened racists"", they surely got some stuff, a lot of stuff, right, and I think shitting on things that have worked for hundreds if not thousands of years of Western Civilization because of the ""possibility"" that a bunch of ""scholars"" from a 60 year old thought school ""may be right"" is nothing but stupid at best and dangerous at worst, and we humans tend to gravitate to the worst.

&gt; How do you even determine cultural aids?

If I instinctively react negatively, I investigate it and determine my opinion. We humans retain instictive behaviours that have worked for millenia, think about how you suddenly jerk your body as if you were falling whilst in bed, apparently it's a vestige from when we still feared predators sneaking on us whilst we slept. The same with everything else, if something seems ""not quite right"" then that's an indicator, but of course rationalism is always above instincts, that's why I investigate further. But so far most of the times it seems off it is in fact off.

&gt; Are you stealthy with your beliefs or lay it all out like the Seinfeld where George shows up naked?

Depends on the context, if you asked me I would tell you of course.

I gotta agree with the other guy too, I think Western ideals and values are the best for mankind. Culture and values are separate though, remember that. What I find funny is that most leftists secretly think the same, or just don't know they think it, but they do. Leftists are the people trying to export ideas like democracy, gender equality, sexual freedom... etc to countries which are completely alien to them. How is that any different to the ""Eurocentrism"" (hate that term, I'm european of course my views and ideals are eurocentric, same as a japanese might be japanocentric and there's literally nothing wrong with that) they disdain so much?

As for race I believe there are differences but they aren't so great as to make us incompatible. But I am an ethno-nationalist because I want to preserve the heritage of my nation. I think that when you know your past you have a purpose in future. I made [this](http://imgur.com/a/MK1ky/noscript) so that you understand why I want small immigration (the people are black to make a contrast of color but you can substitute them by like french people and it'll be the very same situation). Basically, I want to preserve the collective heritage of the nation, but I've no qualms to a few foreigners coming, as long as they become and act like us (the first generation could maintain their native culture in their home but the oncoming generations should be raised in our culture, therefore these generation will raise the next one in our culture too because it's their native one, and the collective heritage will remain the same) and have something to offer to us (like if they're very good proffesionals in their fields, for example), if they have nothing to offer then we have nothing to win from that and there's literally no point in them coming.

70,AntiPOZi,crpfxkn,t1_crpfxkn,I am now not friends with this guy because we politically disagree with each other. The “debate” became very heated and he thought I was insulting him. One fuck you led to another and that is how it ended. I’m thinking about leaving the whole chat here for people to see.

72,AntiPOZi,crl3qiw,t1_crl3qiw,"&gt;Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control

&gt;“We have to find a new balance,” the pope continued, “otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel.”

Greatest sins of our times and we must find a new balance to keep the funds rolling in. In all my years I haven't heard one of those topics mentioned at church. 

Not hardcore, just a realist. church means nothing except an obligation to the majority of parishioners. Why are new priests at an all time low if Vatican ii is such a success and was supposed to appeal to young people?

The only thing I've ever learned through 12 years of rcia or whatever it's called now was acceptance. I take that back, we had a hardcore former marine priest up until I was in 6th grade, after that it became nothing but poz."
73,AntiPOZi,cqz42bp,t1_cqz42bp,"When 99.78% of the population identifies as being one of two things, that's about as close to being binary as you can hope for when it comes to humans. Gender is more binary than pretty much anything else. Name something that greater than 99.78% of humans group themselves into either one of two categories, besides gender."

78,AntiPOZi,cr1mhve,t1_cr1mhve,"I've written a few games but only for myself. None of them have any kind of message, but if I had the time and resources I'd do a game as social commentary on poz. It wouldn't be edgy.

For example, if I had the time and resources I'd love to do a realism mod for Fallout 3 where niggers are only 14% of the population but more than half the time they're the ones attacking or attempting to rob your character. The slavers would be jews and mudslimes selling children to pedofaggots, etc. Basically it would bring the game in line with real world facts.

What would you think of that? "

For me personally, I prefer the idea that we take care of each regardless of lifestyle - whether or not health issues are caused by one night of drinking or a thousand - because we all stand to benefit from a society which values life over death. You simply cannot put a price tag on the peace of mind you get with socialized healthcare.

I've started turning them into mini-interventions. Sure, I can go out on a Saturday and have a huge, fattening feast and not gain an ounce. But the difference between us and them is they have a huge, fattening feast *every day* sometimes more than once - while we spend the rest of our meals eating in a fashion that won't kill us in 15 years. Oh yeah, and I get off of my couch and exercise at least 30 minutes a day. Even if it's just a walk."
