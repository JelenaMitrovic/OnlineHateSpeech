We need to spread the word that ""minorities"" means ""whites not wanted"". This is a racist as racist can be. When you exclude one race for a government program. I'm surprised this racism still exists. Affirmative action was struck down. Someone needs to bring these programs to the supreme court and expose the minority programs for what they are. No whites need apply.

Not enough data yet. Though, fag families differ so much from NORMAL families.

&gt;•Pro-family groups respond with a number of critiques of such studies on homosexual parents. For example, such studies usually have relied on samples that are small and not representative of the population, and they frequently have been conducted by openly homosexual researchers who have an ideological bias on the question being studied. **In addition, these studies also usually make comparisons with children raised by divorced or single parents--rather than with children raised by their married, biological mother and father.**

After the period of stress, if it is something where I feel slighted or angry I try to reason through it and empathize; pick your battles.  For instance, sometimes people I work with can lose their cool on me.  That's fine, they're shooting the messenger because they're in a high pressure environment, or they were raised that way.  I then ask myself several questions:

1)  What implications does this have for me?  Does this stand to affect my working relationship with others, or hurt me in another way?

2)  What is my backup plan?  If I were to lose my job, forced to leave college or whatever other consequence, how would I deal with it?  Am I preparing for my future, saving and formulating a backup plan?


Other times, there is something that legitimately infuriates me.  I use that anger as fuel when I lift.  However, be careful about anger and mental tasks.  Anger and fear release cortisol, and spurs the fight or flight reflex which is is detrimental to making crucial, wise decisions in the heat of the moment.  Calm and collected is the best route.

In the big picture, most of your problems are not life changing so don't let them take years off your life."

&gt;Dear Reader

&gt;As the country goes to the polls, I am taking the unprecedented step of sending you The Telegraph’s leading article.

&gt;That’s because we view this general election as the most important since 1979.

&gt;It marks a watershed moment: do we continue under the Conservatives with the open, enterprise-led economic approach that has underpinned our prosperity for nearly 40 years?

&gt;Or do we revert to an old-style, “government-knows-best” culture championed by the most Left-wing Labour leader for a generation?

&gt;All the frenzied talk about a hung parliament and the surge of the SNP is a distraction because in the end, the choice is straightforward: do we want Mr Cameron to continue in Number 10 or to see Ed Miliband installed as prime minister?

&gt;The Daily Telegraph urges its readers to vote Conservative.

&gt;Yours

&gt;Chris Evans
