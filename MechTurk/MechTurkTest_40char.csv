Gays

&gt;&gt;All homosexual acts were considered criminal in the Netherlands during the German occupation. But only men who had intercourse with young boys were prosecuted, says historian Anna Tijsseling.

&gt;&gt;The Dutch traditionally remember their victims of the Second World War on May 4th. As the queen attends the official ceremonies on Amsterdam's Dam Square, a procession walks to the ‘Homomonument’ near the Western Church. The gay monument was established in 1987 to commemorate the victims of the Nazi regime who were ""persecuted because of their homosexual feelings"".

&gt;&gt;In fact, very few of those people were persecuted in the Netherlands, says historian Anna Tijsseling, who obtained her doctoral degree at Utrecht University on Wednesday for her thesis Guilty sex. Homosexual indecency offences around the German occupation. Actually, the legal prosecution of homosexuals was more intense before and immediately after the war, her research shows.

&gt;&gt;Her conclusions counter the generally accepted view of Dutch homosexuals as victims of the Nazis. Tijsseling calls this image ""a persistent fiction, created by the gay-emancipation movement in the 1970s.""

Overloaded judiciary

&gt;&gt;The historian for the International Institute of Social History and the Netherlands' Institute for War Documentation studied the topic for four years. Part of her research involved investigating all the cases brought before the The Hague district court. ""The Hague was the gay capital of the Netherlands, the way Amsterdam is now. Moreover, many of the cases the Germans did institute against homosexuals took place in The Hague,"" she explains.

&gt;&gt;After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, they made homosexuality a crime. Before and after the war, only those who had sex with minors were prosecuted. ""Homosexuality was seen as a disorder, with older men infecting younger boys, "" Tijsseling said.

&gt;&gt;In theory, the German legislation made it possible to prosecute all gay people. But that didn't happen. Tijsseling’s research shows all the homosexuals who appeared before the court were there for having sex with young boys.

&gt;&gt;One reason why fewer gays were prosecuted was the overloaded judiciary. ""The system was practically buried in/ up to its ears in financial and political crimes. The The Hague police still had a sex crimes department, but fewer cases came before the court. Those convicted were not imprisoned because of a shortage of cells.""

Death camps

&gt;&gt;Several anecdotes Tijsseling found in court files illustrate the relatively safe position of Dutch homosexuals during the occupation. One The Hague pub became an openly gay bar in 1943. And there was one gay man who organised weekly parties in his attic. These became so popular that even German soldiers started attending them. The host was prosecuted in the end, for serving liquor without a licence.

&gt;&gt;But even if few homosexuals were prosecuted, couldn't it be that they were simply sent to death camps without any form of trial? Tijsseling doesn't think so. ""I searched everywhere for evidence of this, but I couldn't find any.""

&gt;&gt;""Homosexuals in Germany were clearly victims of the Nazi regime. They were one of the first groups to be sent to the death camps,"" says Tijsseling. ""But this wasn’t true for the Netherlands.""

&gt;&gt;In the 1950, the emerging gay press wrote mostly about its solidarity with the German victims. In the 1970s a lobby was started to have gays officially recognised as victims of the Nazis. With this status, gay people could apply for reparations. ""And although no evidence had surfaced about gay persecution by then, that idea is now firmly established in people's minds.""

&gt;&gt;She realises her conclusions will not go down well with the gay movement. ""The people who rally around the victimisation of homosexuals will have to face the facts: the Second World War was a relatively quiet time for Dutch gays.""

Handicapped. There was never any program going on to kill the handicapped. What actually went on was, parents who's kids were severely ill, the State allowed for euthanasia, killing them to end their suffering. The parents wanted it. There was outcry from the Church, so Hitler put a stop to it.

Poltical dissedents, you should love your country you live in. If you don't love it, you can leave it.

National Socialism is the most lied about thing of all time. Hitler is the most vilified mad ever, while Stalin killed more people and he hardly ever gets brought up.

Hope I answered your questions.

Also, I should clarify about ""death camps"". They were only  ""found"" where the allies investigated. There were no death camps. The ovens were used to cremate bodies, as I said earlier people were doing from typhus, and when someone dies like that, that's the best way of handling it. "

Point is, you're saying your something your not. There obviously needs to be more research done. I'd love to see some sort of twin study on this matter.

&gt;Yeah I can't change my DNA which sucks. Since my brain is telling me I'm a boy even though I have a girl body. And that fact causes really bad body dysphoria

Well Gender Dysphoria is in the DSM, but transgender was taken out. Why? If the dysphoria is a certified mental disorder than why the fuck isn't CUTTING YOUR DICK OFF. How is that not a mental disorder??!?!! answer: Jews.

&gt;Which is the main reason trans people take HRT. To elevate that dysphoria.

It's a mental illness and should be treated not with HRT.

&gt;In fact the only reason I think y'all are a bunch of jerks for the most part is y'all misgendering us and not wanting us to elevate our dysphoria . And a lot of you wanting us trans people to die a horrible death.

Not misgendering. You don't have a Y chromosome, therefor you are not a man. I don't want anyone to die. I just want people to stop being so loud about it and forcing it down people's throats. I'm sick of cultural Marxism, and transgenderism is one of the many tentacles of Marxism.

&gt;Basically autism is something you're born with. It'a apart of you're brain structure. It's impossible to get it in any other way. Especially vaccines. Besides even if you get autism through vaccines I'd rather have the person live and have autism than have them die of an illness.

Well, over 5000 girls have died from HPV vaccines. Also, they guess the flu vaccine from the previous years strain, and they have never been right.

&gt;Also, jews? why jews? Why not really rich people or something?

http://imgur.com/akHVWfi  They are the really rich people. They use usury to get their way and control a nations people's through money.

&gt; Like trans people for example need both therapy and medicine, while a person with minor depression should just only get therapy to deal with that.

Yes, therapy and medicine that's not any HRT bullshit and gets to the root of the problem.

&gt;Oh and regret? Yeah I can agree with you on that. Basically, If someone thinks they are going to regret surgery then they probably shouldn't get it. Like me for example I definitely want to get surgery to remove my breasts. But I don't want to get some semi-functional dick. I'll just stick to packers for that. (If you don't know what packers are it's essentially a realistic looking plastic dick so you look like you have a male genitals.)

62,GasTheKikes,crqvpl2,t1_crqvpl2,"You're absolutely correct, though I'd argue that this isn't laissez-faire, but corporatism or crony capitalism. It's only huge mega corporations that are treated with a what could be viewed as a ""hands off"" policy from government. Small businesses are being crushed by regulations and government is absolutely stiffing them, which is not laissez-faire at all.

As far as the Gini index and income inequality, this is the result of government action, not a lack thereof. QE infinity and artificially low rates have chased everyone out of the bond market and into the stock market, where the rich are disproportionately ""rewarded"" and the poor and middle class get nothing but inflation. 

This isn't laissez-faire. This isn't the free market. This is the government picking and choosing winners and losers. I agree with you that this is a problem, but I don't believe it's a problem with capitalism or the government being too laissez-faire at all. It's a problem of the Jews enriching themselves at a cost to all of us. It needs to be stopped, and perhaps the answer is more--but entirely different--government. I wouldn't call this capitalism or laissez-faire at all though, which is my entire point.

I agree with you largely and I see a terrible problem exactly where you do. I just see the problem being labeled differently. We're not far off on the solution, either. I'm not advocating for completely laissez-faire policies.

You have to remember how many normal, politically apathetic adults there are - many of them had a political phase when they were young. Not saying there aren't older radlibs, but as a rule they generally mellow out as they age."

71,AntiPOZi,cr6m52w,t1_cr6m52w,"Good on ya, you are spot on. Multigenerational households have been the norm for centuries and really are a facet of Western society.

The reasons it's looked down upon (at least here in the USA) is because of what it's turned into. The vast majority of progeny no longer live at home in order to be closer to their family, or to learn family traditions, or even to assist their parents when get older. They live at home because they are either lazy or have no ambitions, and all they want to do is suck off their parents like a parasite.

It's a shame really because the family can, and should, be something so much more. There are still good people, doing good things. My wife and I lived at my parents house until we were 22. We did chores, had jobs, were productive, visited with family constantly when they came to visit, and had a grand old time. An old friend from high school on the other hand, still lives with his mom, isn't productive, and doesn't contribute anything (he bitches and moans when, if at all, he is told to do the dishes...). Needless to say that we have gone our separate ways quite a while ago. And he wonders why he fights with his mom constantly and I get along great with mine.

A family is not any one person, each member has an important role and tasks to fulfill. When the members, one by one, get corrupted then it turns to shit. "

He's been posted around on various cringe and freakout subs. He once held up a bus full of people because he refused to show his bus pass/ID card.

74,AntiPOZi,cri9ru9,t1_cri9ru9,"Good point, but I still don't know if Fascism is necessary or effective. It would be preferable if we could go back to the way the US was before the 60's (i.e. caps on immigration especially *certain colors*, ending no-fault divorce, abolishing the dept. of Education- it's only been around since the late 70's anyway, outlawing coercive Federal funding to the states which are used as leverage to impose liberal policies that states otherwise would never adopt, and electing a bunch of stuffy Conservatives like Robert Bork to the Supreme Court so that we can go back to the way the courts interpreted free speech before the 60's where only speech was protected as opposed to any kind of artistic or expressive conduct like pornography and vaginal performance art)."
75,AntiPOZi,crb9mo3,t1_crb9mo3,"It is. Linking here is like linking to coontown, fatpeoplehate, or theredpill. Butthurt libtards think it'll get people to join their side hating us, they mistakenly believe that since the upvote system silences and hides dissent in the larger subs that the community agrees with them, in reality it's free advertisement since there are always people that feel the same way as us but don't realize that this place exists, and they have no outlet to discuss these things anywhere else without dealing with a bunch of butthurt liberals putting feels over reals. Nothing makes these subs grow faster than when people bitch about how awful they are on larger subs.
